The IDT maker package for the ARRI ALEXA camera includes the following files:
    README (this file)
    v2_IDT_maker.py
    v3_IDT_maker.py
    AlexaParameters-2013-Nov-13
      Alexa_aces_matrix.txt
      Alexa-st-nd-aces_matrix.txt
    idt_maker_script.csh

v2_IDT_maker.py generates IDTs appropriate for imagery produced with SUP 2.0 firmware loaded.
v3_IDT_maker.py generates IDTs appropriate for imagery produced with SUP 3.0 or later firmware loaded.
The 'raw' v3 IDTs include a variant to handle the different colorimetry produced as a side effect of using the internal ALEXA Studio ND 1.3 filter; it is assumed that somewhere upstream, the corresponding ND 1.3-specific channel gains were used before the deBayer processing.

Both scripts depend on the open-source NumPy library. If running Mac OS X 10.6 or higher, numpy is pre-installed. Users of linux systems, Windows systems, or older Mac OS X systems can find the NumPy package at
     http://sourceforge.net/projects/numpy/files/
     
idt_maker_script.csh was used to generate the files in the subdirectories v2 and v3.
These directories contain a series of .ctl idts created using v2_IDT_maker.py and v3_IDT_maker.py and exist as a convenience rather than running v2_IDT_maker.py and v2_IDT_maker.py.  If any additional IDTs are required or if the validity of an CTL file in these subdirectories is in question v2_IDT_maker.py and v3_IDT_maker.py should be used.
