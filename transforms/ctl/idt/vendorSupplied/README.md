## Important note to users ##
The transforms in this directory have been supplied by, or developed in
conjunction with, the manufacturer. They are provided as part of this repository
for your convenience only. You should not assume the IDTs provided in this
directory are the latest developed by the manufacturer. Every effort is made to
keep these IDTs up-to-date, but users should *always* contact the manufacturer
directly to confirm they have the latest IDTs for their camera.

## Note to camera manufacturers ##
