## Academy Color Encoding System Developer Resources ##

The Academy Color Encoding System (ACES) is a set of components that facilitates
a wide range of motion picture and television workflows while eliminating the ambiguity of
legacy file formats. The system is designed to support both all-digital and
hybrid film-digital motion picture workflows.

The basic ACES components are:

* Color encoding and metric specifications, file format specifications, color
transformations, and an open source reference implementation 
* A set of reference images and calibration targets for film scanners and
recorders 
* Documentation on the system and software tools

This toolkit is intended to serve as a distribution mechanism for key components
of the system, including the reference implementation transforms, reference
images, and documentation.

### Package Contents ###
 
* [`documents/`](./documents) â€“ ACES-related documents 
* [`images/`](./images) - "golden" images created using the reference implementation transforms
* [`transforms/`](./transforms) - ACES reference implementation transforms

### Changes from Previous Releases ###

Though the "master" branch is 1.0.1, the current version of ACES remains 1.0. The 1.0.1 
"patch" release does not add features, change the look, or modify the core transforms 
beyond addressing reported bugs since the Major version release. 

As always, you should check the hotfixes and dev branches for the latest bug fixes and 
new features that will ultimately be rolled into a future version of ACES. These 
improvements will continue to be staged on the dev branch for testing as they become 
available.

Included in ACES 1.0.1:
  * ACES technical documentation has been added as LaTeX source to facilitate tracking of document revisions.
  * Utility functions for making the OCIO config have been added.
  * A bug in piecewise function logic for lin_2_acesProxy() was fixed. 
  * Readability and robustness of some transforms have been improved with suggestions from users.
  * Various typos in transform comments and documentation have been corrected.
  * A broken link to the reference images has been corrected.
  * HDR ODT transforms have been modified
      * The lowest four coefficients for the HDR ODT tonescales have been adjusted in conjunction with a small offset to allow for obtaining a code value of 0.
      * A Rec.2020 version of the 1000 nit ODT has been added.
      * HDR transforms have had references to "PQ" changed to "ST2084".

For a more detailed list of changes see the [CHANGELOG](./CHANGELOG.md) and in the [commit history](https://github.com/ampas/aces-dev/commits/master).

### Versioning ###
 
The links to the current and all past versions of the ACES Developer Resources
can be found at [https://github.com/ampas/aces-dev/releases](https://github.com/ampas/aces-dev/releases).  

Source code is version controlled using the [git version control system](http://git-scm.com/) and hosted on GitHub at [https://github.com/ampas/aces-dev/](https://github.com/ampas/aces-dev/).

Individual files now conform to the ACES System Versioning Specification.  Details can be found in the Academy Specification "S-2014-002 - Academy Color Encoding System - Versioning System" included in [`documents/`](./documents)

### Branch Structure ###

__Master Branch__
 
The current release version of ACES can always be found at the HEAD of the
master branch.  The master branch contains no intermediate commits and all commits on
the master branch are tagged to represent a release of ACES.

__Dev Branch__
 
Intermediate commits between releases will be staged on the dev branch.  Commits staged 
on the dev branch, but not yet merged into the master, should be considered as "planned 
for inclusion" in the next release version.  Commits on the dev branch will ultimately 
be merged into the master branch as part of a future release.

__Hotfixes Branch__

In some instances it may be necessary to create a hotfixes branch.  The hotfixes
branch will include important, but not fully tested, fixes for bugs found in a
particular release.  Hotfixes should only be implemented by developers if the bug they 
are intending to correct is encountered in the course of production and is deemed to be 
a barrier to using a particular ACES release.  Hotfixes, once fully tested, will
be merged into the dev branch, and ultimately the master.
