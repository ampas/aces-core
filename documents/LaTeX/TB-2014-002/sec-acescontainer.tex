\chapter{ACES Container}

Please refer to the SMPTE ST 2065-4:2013.  This is an image file format (based on OpenEXR) for storing images in the ACES2065-1 color encoding.

The recommended end-user name for this file format is an ``ACES container.''

\section{Guidelines}
\subsection{Assigning default color space}
When reading ACES container files, the color space should default to ACES2065-1.

\subsection{File metadata}
Products should read and write the metadata in the header of the container file as per the SMPTE specification.
