\summary{
The Academy Color Encoding System (ACES) is the industry standard for managing color throughout the life-cycle of a motion picture or television production (from creation, thru editorial, grading, audience presentation, and archiving).

Early adopters of technology products tend to be quite technology-savvy. One of the main goals of the release of ACES 1.0 is to broaden the user base beyond the very technically-oriented early adopters. In order to make it more accessible to a wider audience of users, it is necessary to make the ACES User Experience (ACES UX) simpler and more consistent across products.

This document provides guidelines for those building products that implement ACES and to others looking for guidance on how best to present ACES terminology and concepts to end-users.

Those implementing ACES in products should also refer to the Logo Program Requirements and Usage document.
