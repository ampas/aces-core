\appendixchapter{Convention for use of ACESproxy SMPTE range}{i}
\label{appendixC}

This appendix defines the equivalent of a [0.0 \ldots{} 1.0] range in both 10-bit and 12-bit ACESproxy for use in applications.

For consistency in using ACESproxy values in video systems designed around the [0.0 \ldots{} 1.0] video range (encoded in 10-bit video as the range 64-940), the following ACES values are considered the equivalents to 0.0 and 1.0 for both 10-bit and 12-bit video.


\begin{center}
\begin{tabularx}{0.75\textwidth}{|Y|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
\textbf{Video normalized scale} & \textbf{IRE} & \textbf{10-bit CV} & \textbf{12-bit CV} & \textbf{ACES} \\ \hline
0.0 & 0\% & 64 & 256 & 0.001185417 \\ \hline
1.0 & 100\% & 940 & 3760 & 222.875 \\ \hline
\end{tabularx}

ASC CDL values are applied to values in the range [0.0 \ldots{} 1.0] which by this convention are set to ACES values 0.001185417 to 222.875. In integer based color grading systems this is typically accomplished by scaling from ``legal'' to full range before applying ASC CDL transforms. The ASC CDL application is further defined in a separate document.
