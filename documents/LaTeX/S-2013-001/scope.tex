This document specifies 10-bit and 12-bit integer encodings of ACES for use with imaging systems that produce look metadata such as ASC CDL, and with transport systems such as HD-SDI. The color encoding provided in this format represents ACES relative exposure values as RGB triplets in a logarithmic encoding, and does not define the interfaces or signals that may carry this encoding.
