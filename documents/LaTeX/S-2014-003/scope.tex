This document describes a 32-bit floating point encoding of ACES for use within color grading systems. It is intended to be compatible with on-set look metadata generated from systems using the ACESproxy encodings specified in ``Academy S-2013-001.'' Equivalent functions may be used for implementation purposes as long as correspondence of grading parameters to this form of log implementation is properly maintained. This document is intended as a guideline to aid developers who are integrating an ACES workflow into a color correction system.
