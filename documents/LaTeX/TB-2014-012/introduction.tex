ACES component names have technical names that emerged from the engineering and development process. While the names make sense to the scientists, engineers and early adopters that ``grew up'' with the system, the larger adoption community targeted for adoption by ACES Version 1.0 does not have the historical knowledge and context of the ACES pioneers and a large majority of that community does not have the technical training needed to understand many of the existing names.

This Technical Bulletin documents the ACES component naming conventions as agreed to by the ACES Project Committee for the ACES 1.0 System Release.
