This Technical Bulletin document ACES Version 1.0 component names. These names were settled on after extensive discussions at ACES Project Committee meetings, feedback from the field, internal discussions amongst the ACES Leadership Team and the work of the ACES User Experience Working Group. The names documented herein rationalize naming approaches between diverse technical components, are technically correct, sensible for end users, acknowledge terminology that seems to have ``stuck'' and accommodate system evolution. Words instead of acronyms are used where possible, and the ACES prefix was liberally used to promote a system identity.
