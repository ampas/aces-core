This document describes the translation of ACES2065-1 to/from ACEScg. ACEScg is intended as an appropriate working space for CGI rendering and compositing. ACEScg utilizes the AP1 color primaries for the purpose of rendering and compositing computer generated imagery (CGI). These primaries are the same as those used by the ACEScc working space.
