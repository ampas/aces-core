\chapter{Terminology}

These terms should be introduced:

Viewing Transform (or View Transform) -- Generally, a color transformation that converts values from a working space into colorimetry for a display device. Specifically in this context, the Viewing Transform is what contains the Academy-supplied algorithms for converting scene-referred ACES values into colorimetry for a given viewing environment and class of display.

Display Transform -- A color transformation that converts colorimetry intended to be reproduced on a display into the code values that must be sent to the device.
