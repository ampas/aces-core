\chapter{The role of the RRT}

Please note that although the RRT acronym is not used in the suggested terminology, it still remains an essential piece of the engineering and conceptual model of ACES. The role of the RRT is to define the baseline ACES rendering. Even though there are multiple Viewing Transforms for the viewing environments and classes of display (e.g. standard and extended dynamic range), these are all designed to match the RRT to the extent possible. This is what gives the ACES renderings a consistent appearance across a wide range of viewing environments and display technologies.
