\chapter{External References}

The ACESclip file may be externally referenced in an EDL file to assign different ACES pipeline configurations to different segments of a timeline.    Use the following comment field in an EDL for this purpose:

001 Clipname  V             %___________  __________ ___________ ___________

*ACES\_ClipXML:   myshow\_LMTnight\_A0001.xml

The file name convention is user-defined.

Applications importing an EDL with such a comment field should set its viewing pipeline based on the \textit{aces:Config} value for a particular marked section of the timeline.
