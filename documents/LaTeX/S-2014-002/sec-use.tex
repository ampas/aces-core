\chapter{Use of Version Control}

ACES system versioning and Transform Identifiers shall be used by ACES Product Partners to identify ACES components that ship with their products. ACES versioning/naming conventions and Transform Identifiers shall also be used in the ACES Clip-level Metadata File that their products create and/or modify. Doing so enables end users to unambiguously view ACES image files by identifying the correct ACES transform chain for a given collection of ACES image files.
