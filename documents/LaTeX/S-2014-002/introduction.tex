The key components of the ACES system are ACES encodings, ACES image files, ACES transforms and associated files, and an ACES clip-level metadata container that describes how the ACES image files were viewed when created or modified. ACES Version 1.0 is the first official release of these components. These components may be enhanced in subsequent releases based on industry requirements. Feedback from ACES Product Partners and end users made it clear that such a dynamic environment requires a clear system for version-control and naming of ACES components.


This document describes the versioning of the engineering components that comprise the ACES System Release to ACES Product Partners. These version numbers are intended to be used within ACES files such as transforms and the ACES clip-level metadata container. A separate document, Academy TB-2014-002, addresses naming and versioning issues as they relate to end-users.
