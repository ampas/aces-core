\chapter{Notes on SMPTE ST 2065-4}

SMPTE ST 2065-4 -- ACES Image Container File Layout specifies a standard file container for ACES data. The ACES Image Container is intended to be compatible with software and hardware capable of reading and writing the OpenEXR format though the ACES Image Container does not support all the features of OpenEXR. The ACES Image Container serves as an internationally standardized file format for interchange and archival. In practice, ACES data may be interchanged in OpenEXR or the ACES Image Container depending on the feature set required for production.

The Academy provides an open source ACES Image Container file writer reference implementation available on GitHub at http://www.github.com/ampas. Those wishing to implement the standard should refer to the SMPTE document which can be obtained from the Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers.
