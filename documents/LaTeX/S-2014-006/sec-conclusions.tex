The XML format provides an extensible and straightforward method for exchanging LUT and matrix data between users and facilities. New types of \texttt{ProcessNode}s can be defined in the future to handle other desired forms of color processing. Among possible additions are nodes that provide  CTL (Color Transformation Language) processing or custom formula transforms such as the ACES RRT.

Feedback from users and from implementers may lead to changes in the specification or schema, so readers should verify usage of the latest version of this document. At this time, there is no reference implementation available for distribution.

The Academy/ASC Common LUT Format is a powerful tool for handling the exchange of LUTs and color transformations between facilities.  It has the potential to become an archival element that would be as useful to the industry as the paper tape timing lights still found today in film cans.
