This document introduces a human-readable text file format for the interchange of color transformations using an XML schema. The XML format supports Look-Up Tables of several types: 1D LUTs, 3D LUTs, and 3by1D LUTs, as well as additional transformation needs such as matrices, range rescaling, and `shaper LUTs.'
