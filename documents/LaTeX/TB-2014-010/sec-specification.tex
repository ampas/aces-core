\chapter{Specification}

\section{Inputs}
The inputs to an LMT are ACES RGB relative exposure values.

\section{Outputs}
The outputs of an LMT are ACES RGB relative exposure values.

\section{Working space}
The internal working space of an LMT is unrestricted. An LMT may internally transform its inputs into a non-ACES space and perform color operations there, as long as it transforms the results of those back to ACES before yielding them as outputs.

\section{Syntax}
LMTs are specified in Common LUT XML.

\section{Transport}
LMT metadata is carried in the ACESclip container file within the ACES\_Config element. Multiple LMTs are referenced in the TransformList element and are applied in the order in which they are referenced.
