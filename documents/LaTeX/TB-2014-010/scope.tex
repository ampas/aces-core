This document describes the use of ACES Look Modification Transforms (LMTs) for ACES-based color management. It provides several use cases for LMTs, defines how LMTs are expressed and are carried along with clips and projects, discusses LMT use in the context of a workflow employing ACES-based color management, and concludes with design guidelines for LMTs. This document also describes optimal use of LMTs and suggests several ways in which an LMT may be designed to support flexible mastering and archiving workflows.
