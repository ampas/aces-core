The procedures described in this guide are appropriate for the creation of Input Device Transforms (IDTs) for digital still cameras or digital motion picture camera systems that directly or indirectly provide radiometrically linear focal-plane-referred camera system RGB code values, i.e. that have not been color rendered, and which provide for any dark current subtraction, gain correction (flat fielding), deblurring, and/or noise filtering prior to the application of an IDT. 

The procedures provided in this guide are intended for use by camera system manufacturers. Those procedures are not intended for use by Directors of Photography (DPs), nor for on-set technical personnel working under their supervision (e.g. Digital Imaging Technicians (DITs)), as it is expected the camera system manufacturer will provide IDTs for `standard' capture environments, and that those manufacturer-provided IDTs will have a level of quality difficult to match in the field.

IDT authors are the digital counterparts of film emulsion designers. Authors of LMTs are the digital counterparts of film lab technicians, film color timers, or traditional cinematographers who `paint with the camera;' as such, LMT authors are recommended to read this document, since their task will be to process the results of transforms developed using the procedures it provides.
