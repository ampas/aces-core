\chapter{Notes on SMPTE ST 2065-1}

The document S-2008-001 -- Academy Color Encoding Specification (ACES) was published prior to SMPTE ST 2065-1. S-2008-001 served as the basis for the SMPTE document but is now superseded by the SMPTE standard. S-2008-001, included in Appendix \ref{appendixA} of this document, is provided for historical reference. Those wishing to implement the standard should refer to the SMPTE document, which can be obtained from SMPTE.
